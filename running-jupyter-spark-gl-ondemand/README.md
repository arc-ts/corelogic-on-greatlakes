Advanced Research Computing (ARC)  provides an [online guide](https://arc.umich.edu/open-ondemand/) about the Open OnDemand service for the Great Lakes cluster at the University of Michigan. The online guide describes how you can start different interactive apps on the Great Lakes (GL) cluster, including Jupyter notebooks.

In this guide, we talk specifically about how to start a Jupyter notebook with Spark (PySpark) enabled.

## 1. Use Duo
Two-factor authentication is required to use Open On Demand (OOD) at the University of Michigan. More information about Duo can be found [here](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/two-factor-authentication).

## 2. Have a user login and access to an account


## 3. Be connected to the U-M campus network
To connect to Great Lakes OnDemand, you either need to be using a computer on campus or connect to the campus network using [VPN](https://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/vpn/getting-started).

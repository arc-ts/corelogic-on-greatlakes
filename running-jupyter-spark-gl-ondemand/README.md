# How to start an Open On Demand (OnDemand/OOD) session on Great Lakes (GL) and load a Jupyter Notebook with Spark enabled

Advanced Research Computing (ARC)  provides an [online guide](https://arc.umich.edu/open-ondemand/) about the Open OnDemand service for the Great Lakes cluster at the University of Michigan. The online guide describes how you can start different interactive apps on the Great Lakes (GL) cluster, including Jupyter notebooks.

In this guide, we talk specifically about how to start a Jupyter notebook with Spark (PySpark) enabled.

## 1. Use Duo
Two-factor authentication is required to use Open On Demand (OOD) at the University of Michigan. More information about Duo can be found [here](https://safecomputing.umich.edu/two-factor-authentication).

## 2. Have a user login and access to an account
You will need your own user login (which you can request [here](https://arc.umich.edu/login-request)) and have an account that will pay for the use of the computing cluster. Accounts are available to faculty via the U-M Research Computing package ([UMRCP](https://arc.umich.edu/umrcp/)),  for classes, coursework and workshops (see [here](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/course-accounts/) for more information on course accounts), and for student teams and organizations (more info [here](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/studentteams/)). Users who do not qualify for any of the aforementioned programs can purchase an account based on the [current rates](https://arc.umich.edu/greatlakes/rates/) for the Great Lakes Cluster.

## 3. Connect to the U-M campus network
To connect to Great Lakes OnDemand, you either need to be using a computer on campus or connect to the campus network using [VPN](https://its.umich.edu/enterprise/wifi-networks/vpn/getting-started).

## 4. Open a new web browser tab and navigate to the cluster
For web browsers, Firefox, Edge, or Chrome in incognito mode are recommended. Navigate to [greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu](greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu), which will prompt you to complete two-factor authentication via Duo.


## 5. Select Jupyter + Spark Basic under Interactive Apps
In the top left menu, go to "Interactive Apps" and select "Jupyter + Spark Basic" from the drop-down menu.
